# Notes 

- I divided the application in 3 major features: Log In, Invoice Links and Invoice Details
- The period of tests  of the development sprint should not be confused with the Regression tests period. They have distinct purpose and quality is totally about this, smartly plan, divide and use the time with technique. 
- I consider both Functional and Non-Function tests very important to be run during the development sprint (feature branch), before the Regression tests.
- Note that all regression test cases also pass through the log in functionality, so the Log in will be always compulsorily tested during a new version validation.
- The test cases with data table, which are TC013, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 21, I created a scheme of scenario where we can treat all entries in the same BDD test case, so we optimize the time.
